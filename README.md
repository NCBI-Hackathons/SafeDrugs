### Goal <a name="goal"></a>

- Using a standardized dataset of adverse drug reactions from the FDA (AEOLUS, see resources for link to paper), provide a web app for interacting and visualizing with this unique data source. 

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

```
git clone git@github.com:NCBI-Hackathons/SafeDrugs.git <br />
cd path/to/SafeDrug/directory <br />
pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
```

### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

- See introduction in app

- There has been a lot of development by the FDA in providing tools and apps using their API to query their ADR data. 

- As is, the FDA data is not standardized and so contains redundancy and ambiguity in their data (e.g. aspirin and aspirin 81mg). Using a standardized version of their data can provide additional clarity representing ADR data. Our app would be another community tool to possibly add to their online portfolio (see OpenFDA community tools).
